# Kompiler

This project is an attempt of writting a compiler from scratch on a toy language I call K! (k-bang).

Some code examples for k! can be found on the examples directory.

Everything is written in Haskell... Let's see how it turns out...

## TODO
- bug in function return paths;
- bug in scope for recusive calls;
